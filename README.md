# pylocksfile

pylocksfile is a simple python package for linux-based systems. This package takes advantage of linux's internal file-system locking mechanism and provided a simple read/write locking interface for inter-process communication.

## Advantages

*pylocksfile* has several advantages over the native python locks:

*	Allow read/write (shared/exclusive) locking mechanising.
*	Significantly smaller over-head for *acquire*/*release* operations.
*	Supports many different locks within a single *pylocksfiles* (hence the **locks** in *pylocksfile*).
*	Interval-based locking mechanising. Supports multiple *acquire*/*release* operations simultaneously, as long as locks indices are consecutive.
*	Locks are shared via linux file-system, so there is no need to pass the lock object upon process creation, any process may share it at any time.
*	Linux provides dead-lock detection, for up to 10 locks dependencies.

## Usage and Examples

```Python
from pylocksfile import pylocksfile

#Create a pylocksfile object. "dataLocksFile.lock" will be the locking file
locksfile = pylocksfile(locksfile_path = "dataLocksFile.lock", verbose = False, l_id = 'process_1')

#Acquiring lock 0 for reading (shared lock) with blocking
locksfile.acquire(writeLock = False, lock_n = 0, blocking = True)

# Do some reading (shared) operation assosiated lock 0.

#Acquiring locks 1,2,3 for writing (exclusive lock) with blocking
locksfile.acquire(writeLock = True, lock_n = (1,3), blocking = True)

# Do some writing (exclusive) operation assosiated locks 1,2,3. 
# Do some reading (shared) operation assosiated lock 0.

#Using 'with' statement. Notice (2,1) means offset of 1 locks from lock 2, hence it is equivalent to 'lock_n = 2'.
with locksfile(writeLock = False, lock_n = (2,1)):
	#Converts lock 2 to read (shared). Do read (shared) operation on 0,2 and write (exclusive) on 1,3
	pass

# Do some writing (exclusive) operation assosiated locks 1,3. 
# Do some reading (shared) operation assosiated lock 0.

#Releasing lock 0.
locksfile.release(lock_n = (0,1))

#Releasing all locks from 3 to 1000
locksfile.release(lock_n = (3,997))

#Release all the locks
locksfile.release()

#End of script. On destruction of pylocksfile object, all remaining locks will be freed.
return
```
